# File Stream Integrator

This project is a simple microservices-based file upload service designed to familiarize users with core system architectures and Docker containerization. The service integrates with several tools, including Kafka, MinIO, PostgreSQL, and Python-based producer/consumer scripts, to manage file upload and processing workflows.

## Features
1. **File Upload and Storage**:
   - Users provide file metadata (e.g., URL, bucket name) to the producer, which stores this data in PostgreSQL.
2. **Stream Processing**:
   - The consumer retrieves file URLs from PostgreSQL, streams the files, and uploads them to MinIO using a pre-signed URL.
3. **Verification**:
   - After file upload, the consumer updates PostgreSQL with file metadata, including size and checksum (ETag).

---

## Architecture Overview

The service architecture consists of:
- **Producer**: A script that accepts user input and stores metadata in PostgreSQL.
- **Consumer**: A script that streams files, uploads them to MinIO, and updates PostgreSQL with additional metadata.
- **Kafka + Zookeeper**: A message broker used for decoupled communication between producer and consumer.
- **MinIO**: An S3-compatible object storage system for file uploads.
- **PostgreSQL**: A database to store file metadata.
- **Web Interfaces**:
  - Kafka UI: Accessible at `http://localhost:8080`
  - MinIO UI: Accessible at `http://localhost:9001`

## Prerequisites

### Software Requirements:
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+
- Required Python packages (installed via `requirements.txt`):
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Dependencies:
- **Kafka and Zookeeper**: For message brokering.
- **MinIO**: For object storage.
- **PostgreSQL**: For database storage.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Setup with Docker Compose
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moeinahmadieh81/FileStreamIntegrator.git
   cd FileStreamIntegrator
   ```
2. Start all services using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build --scale producer=0 --scale consumer=0 -d
   ```
3. Verify services are running:
   - Kafka UI: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
   - MinIO UI: [http://localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001)

### Step 2: Run the Producer
Run the producer script to accept file metadata and store it in PostgreSQL:
```bash
docker run -it --rm --network=web-hw3_mynetwork -e POSTGRES_DB=simpleapi_database -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e KAFKA_LISTENER_NAME_INTERNAL=kafka:9092 producer/latest:latest
```

Expected input for the producer:
- File URL (e.g., `http://example.com/file.jpg`)
- Bucket name
- File identifier

### Step 3: Run the Consumer
Run the consumer script to process files from the queue, upload them to MinIO, and update metadata in PostgreSQL:
```bash
docker run -it --rm --network=web-hw3_mynetwork -e POSTGRES_DB=simpleapi_database -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e KAFKA_LISTENER_NAME_INTERNAL=kafka:9092 -e MINIO_ROOT_USER=minioadmin -e MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD=minioadmin consumer/latest:latest
```

## Database Schema

The PostgreSQL table structure for file metadata:

| **Column**      | **Description**                    |
|------------------|------------------------------------|
| `id`            | Unique identifier for the file     |
| `file_url`      | URL of the file                    |
| `bucket_name`   | Name of the MinIO bucket           |
| `object_name`   | Name of the object in MinIO        |
| `etag`          | Checksum of the uploaded file      |
| `size`          | Size of the file in bytes          |

---

## Key Features and Highlights

1. **Pre-signed URL**:
   - The consumer generates a pre-signed URL for file uploads, ensuring security and access control.

2. **Chunked File Upload**:
   - Supports uploading large files in chunks for efficient processing.

3. **Verification**:
   - File size and checksum verification ensure successful uploads.

4. **Graphical Interfaces**:
   - Kafka and MinIO provide intuitive graphical UIs for managing data.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Custom Configurations**:
  - Chunk size for large file uploads can be adjusted in the consumer script.

- **Error Handling**:
  - The consumer retries processing messages in case of failures, ensuring reliability.

- **Testing**:
  - Verify uploaded files in the MinIO UI.
